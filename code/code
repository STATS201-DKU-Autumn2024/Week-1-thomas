# Data Analysis Report

## 1. Natural Language Processing and Social Network Study

### Data Generation Process
In this step, we simulate a social network of 200 nodes, with edges randomly connecting nodes based on a probability threshold. Additionally, each node is assigned a text post based on one of several thematic topics (e.g., "technology," "politics"). We generate text data with these themes embedded, creating a context for a network-based topic analysis.

### Data Visualization
We visualize the network structure to see the connections and examine the distribution of node degrees, providing insights into which nodes are most connected or central.

### Code and Visualization
```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
